# How to Install (macOS)

## Prerequisites
Before installing swiftGuard, ensure that FileVault is enabled on your Mac. This step is crucial as swiftGuard's security measures are most effective when FileVault is activated. To enable FileVault:
1. Open "System Preferences" from the Apple menu.
2. Navigate to "Security & Privacy" and select the "FileVault" tab.
3. Click on the lock icon and enter your password to make changes.
4. Enable FileVault but ensure that iCloud recovery is **not** activated (note your recovery key!).

## Installation
Follow the steps below to install swiftGuard on your macOS:

1. Obtain the most recent version of swiftGuard by downloading it from the [Releases](https://github.com/Lennolium/swiftGuard/releases/latest) page.
2. Open the downloaded `swiftGuard.dmg` file.
3. Drag the swiftGuard application into the Applications folder.
4. Open the swiftGuard application from the Applications folder by right-clicking and selecting "Open". If you encounter a warning that the application is from an unidentified developer, follow the steps below:
   - Open "System Preferences" from the Apple menu.
   - Navigate to "Security & Privacy" and click on "Open Anyway" to allow the application to run.

swiftGuard should now appear in the macOS system tray. Test the shutdown or hibernation feature to ensure it executes correctly. You may be prompted to grant necessary permissions by macOS during the first run.

## Upgrade from an Older Version
To upgrade swiftGuard to a newer version, follow the steps below:

1. Close the currently running swiftGuard application. You can do this by accessing the tray menu and clicking on the application icon, then selecting "Exit".
2. Open the newly downloaded `swiftGuard.dmg` file.
3. Drag the swiftGuard application from the new package into the Applications folder, replacing the old version when prompted.

After completing these steps, you should have successfully installed or updated swiftGuard on your macOS device.
