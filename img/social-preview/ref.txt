Hello,

I'm a young developer and computer science student.
I worked for several months hardly on a free, open source macOS application, which I think might be very interesting for you and your community :)
Its a app which sits in you menu tray and guards your USB ports. If anybody tries to insert a (malicious) usb stick, it will trigger a shutdown or other custom actions.

Get in touch with me, if this sounds interesting to you.

Anti-forensic macOS tray application designed to safeguard your system by monitoring USB ports. It ensures your device's security by automatically initiating either a system shutdown or hibernation if an unauthorized device connects or a connected device is unplugged. It offers the flexibility to whitelist designated devices, to select an action to be executed and to set a countdown timer, allowing to disarm the shutdown process.

# What it offers

* **Monitoring:** Continuously monitors USB ports for device activity, even in sleep mode.
* **Whitelisting:** Allows users to whitelist authorized devices, ensuring hassle-free connectivity.
* **Discrete:** Operates in the macOS system tray, minimizing interruptions.
* **Customizable:** Allows users to configure various settings, including action (shutdown/hibernate), countdown timer and whitelist.
* **Lightweight:** Designed to consume minimal system resources for optimal performance.
* **Privacy:** Does not require an internet connection, ensuring the privacy of your data.
* **Open Source:** Provides transparency and allows community contributions for continuous development.

## See it in Action!

&#x200B;

## Why should You care?

A few reasons to use this tool:

* **Anti-Forensic Measures:** In case the police or other thugs break in. The police often use a [mouse jiggler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_jiggler) to prevent the screen saver or sleep mode from being activated.
* **Prevent Data Exfiltration:** You do not want someone adding or copying documents to or from your computer via USB.
* **Public Environments:** If you frequently use your Mac in public places like libraries or cafes, swiftGuard acts as an additional layer of security against physical attacks in a [potentially vulnerable](https://www.ccn.com/fbi-illegally-stole-ross-ulbrichts-laptop-brought-silk-road/) setting.
* **Server Protection:** You want to improve the security of your home or company server (e.g. your Raspberry Pi, NAS, etc.).
* **Data Protection Regulations:** Many industries and organizations are subject to strict data protection regulations. swiftGuard helps maintain compliance by preventing unauthorized data transfers and access through USB ports.

>**Tip**: You might also want to use a cord to attach a USB key to your wrist. Then plug the key into your computer and run swiftGuard. If your computer is robbed, the USB is removed and the computer shuts down immediately.

Â 

## What Features are planned next?

* **Bluetooth:** If a Bluetooth Device (tries to) connect(s), or if a new Bt Device comes near you MacBook, swiftGuard will shutdown/hibernate.
* **More Actions:** When it detects a Manipulation swiftGuard is able to delete or encrypt files/folders, wipe ram, send an email notification, ...)
* **Custom Actions:** You can define custom shell/python commands to be executed, e.g., run a script.
* **Linux Support:** Cross-platform support.
* **Encryption:** More security on top, with password protected configuration and defusing.
* **Auto Start/Update:** I think this one is clear.

PULL REQUEST:
I added the macOS OpSec-enhancing Application 'swiftGuard' to the category 'Detection, Alerting and Automation Platforms'. If you think it would fit somewhere else, please feel free to edit.

It's a lightweight tool that safeguards your systems USB ports for any unauthorized access and initiates a shutdown or hibernation in case of threat detection.

Dear Ricard,

My Name is Lennart Haack and I'm a Bioinformtics graduate at the Goethe University of Frankfurt in Germany. 
For the couple last months I developed an open source macOS Application called 'swiftGuard', which might be interesting for you and your blog. 
It's an Application which sits in your Menu Tray and guards your USB ports (even in sleep mode). If someone tries to insert a (malicious) USB Device or a connected Device gets removed, it will trigger a shutdown or other custom actions. It is a revival of the abandoned usbkill project by Hephaestos. So far it offers a whitelist for devices, extensive configuration, an intuitive Graphical User Interface and is lightweight and does not require an internet connection. Its by far perfectly programmed and complete, but for me it is an intrinsic passion to optimize it and my operational security, so I'll continue developing and pushing it :)

For more detailed Information please feel free to visit the Project on Github: https://github.com/Lennolium/swiftGuard


So my Idea would be, that you could maybe add it to your Blog Post 'Hardening macOS' (https://www.bejarano.io/hardening-macos/) under the Category 'The advanced stuff'. I do not want to offensively spam/advertise my Work to you. I really think, it would improve your well curated List and help others. At my point of development I need Feedback from Users to improve and continue the Application. You'd really help an young student developer out :)

I wrote an Example Paragraph, you could add or take as Inspiration for your Blog Post:


The Advanced stuff

[...]

21.	Monitor your USB ports
	Why? 	In public places like libraries or cafes, you need an additional layer of security, next to encryption, against physical attacks in a potentially vulnerable setting. You do not want a malicious actor copying data from or to your device.
	How?	Install and configure swiftGuard.


I want to thank you in Advance for your precious Time and your well-written Blog!

Sincerely,
Lennart Haack
